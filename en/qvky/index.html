                QVKY—also known as moonlight photography night—is a photography
                competition hosted annually by Vastavalo.

            <h2 id="qvky-2024">QVKY 2024</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>QVKY 2024 will be held toward the end of the year, as per tradition. Stay tuned!</strong>
            </p>
            <h2 id="qvky-rules">Rules and other things</h2>
            <p>
                The competition is free and open to everyone. You do not have to be a
                member of Vastavalo in order to participate.
            </p>
            <p>
                QVKY is a team competition. There is no limit to the team size, but
                please be reasonable. We’ve found three to four people works best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both live and remote participation is possible. Remote participation
                requires <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each team should have one camera (film, digital, phone etc) of their
                own. All photographs should be taken with the same camera.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are six assignments to photograph and they are given according
                to the schedule below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>18:00 Competition starts, assignments 1 &#x26; 2</li>
                <li>20:00 Assignments 3 &#x26; 4</li>
                <li>22:00 Assignments 5 &#x26; 6</li>
                <li>00:00 Competition ends</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Teams get instructions on how to return the assignments at the
                competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The technical quality of the photographs is not the focus here. The
                main idea is to have fun while taking photographs.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the assignments carry a common secret theme. One way to do well is
                to figure out the theme and show that in your photographs.
