        <p>
          The competition is free and open to everyone. You do not have to be a
          member of Vastavalo in order to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          QVKY is a team competition. There is no limit to the team size, but
          please be reasonable. We’ve found three to four people works best.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both live and remote participation is possible. Remote participation
          requires <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each team should have one camera (film, digital, phone etc) of their
          own. All photographs should be taken with the same camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are six assignments to photograph and they are given according
          to the schedule below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>18:00 Competition starts, assignments 1 &#x26; 2</li>
          <li>20:00 Assignments 3 &#x26; 4</li>
          <li>22:00 Assignments 5 &#x26; 6</li>
          <li>00:00 Competition ends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Teams get instructions on how to return the assignments at the
          competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technical quality of the photographs is not the focus here. The
          main idea is to have fun while taking photographs.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the assignments carry a common secret theme. One way to do well is
          to figure out the theme and show that in your photographs.
