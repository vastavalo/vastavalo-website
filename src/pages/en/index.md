# Vastavalo

## The club

Camera Club Vastavalo is the camera club of Tampere University, and it provides you an open-minded view to the world of photography. We have something to offer for everybody, from those who take photos only occasionally to those who are passionate aesthetes. Our camera club’s activities are open for everyone.

## Activities

Vastavalo organizes photography-themed gatherings, events, and competitions, courses on different aspects of photography, such as photography for beginners and the use of the darkroom, as well as excursions, presentations, and exhibitions. We maintain the darkroom located in Vanha Domus.

## Membership

You don’t have to be a member to join Camera Club Vastavalo’s activities, but members get a discount on the darkroom rent, trips, exhibition tickets, courses and other events.

Members are important to our club since the fees help us fund all sorts of fun events.

### How to join

The membership is for one academic year (September–August), so it’s important that you remember to renew your membership.

You can join us by paying 5 euros to our account FI77 47265 0200 38232.

Remember to write in the message field:
