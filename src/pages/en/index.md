# Vastavalo

Camera Club Vastavalo is the camera club of Tampere University, and it provides you an open-minded view to the world of photography. We have something to offer for everybody, from those who take photos only occasionally to those who are passionate aesthetes. The activities of our club are open for everyone.

Vastavalo organizes photography-themed gatherings, events, and competitions, courses on different aspects of photography, such as photography for beginners and the use of the darkroom, as well as excursions, presentations, and exhibitions. We maintain the darkroom located in Vanha Domus.
