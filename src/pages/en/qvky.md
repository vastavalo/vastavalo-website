# QVKY

QVKY—also known as moonlight photography night—is a photography competition hosted annually by Vastavalo.

## QVKY 2023

**QVKY 2023 will be held on Friday 27th of October.**

The competition starts at 18:00 and lasts until midnight. Live participation takes place at [Games As Art Center](https://gamesasartcenter.com) (Voimakatu 11). Remote participants get separate instructions on how to attend.

## Rules and other things

The competition is free and open to everyone. You do not have to be a member of Vastavalo in order to participate.

QVKY is a team competition. There is no limit to the team size, but please be reasonable. We've found three to four people works best.

Both live and remote participation is possible. Remote participation requires [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).

Each team should have one camera (film, digital, phone etc) of their own. All photographs should be taken with the same camera.

There are six assignments to photograph and they are given according to the schedule below:

- 18:00 Competition starts, assignments 1 & 2
- 20:00 Assignments 3 & 4
- 22:00 Assignments 5 & 6
- 00:00 Competition ends

Teams get instructions on how to return the assignments at the competition.

The technical quality of the photographs is not the focus here. The main idea is to have fun while taking photographs.

All the assignments carry a common secret theme. One way to do well is to figure out the theme and show that in your photographs.
